Hackathon Submission - United Airlines Call Center Optimization
This repository contains the source code and analysis for the United Airlines Hackathon. The project focuses on optimizing key call center metrics like Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST), while analyzing patterns in call reasons, agent performance, and customer satisfaction.

Project Overview
The project uses data-driven methodologies to identify inefficiencies in call center operations and provide actionable recommendations for improving customer service. The main tasks include:

Analysis of call center data to determine drivers of long AHT and AST.
Identification of high-frequency issues and proposing self-service options via IVR (Interactive Voice Response).
Visualizations and insights derived from customer and agent tones, call reasons, and agent performance.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python: Primary programming language.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Machine Learning: To uncover patterns and predict call reasons using text analysis (CountVectorizer) and other algorithms.
